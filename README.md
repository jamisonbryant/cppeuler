# CppEuler

This repository contains my implementations of the solutions to the mathetmatical
and logic problems presented on the [Project Euler](http://projecteuler.net) site.

As you can probably discern from the title of the repository, I chose to solve the
problems using C/C++, because this is the language I will use most in my career.
